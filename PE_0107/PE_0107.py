Minimal network


BorÅ¯vka's algorithm (See wikipedia)
  Input: A connected graph G whose edges have distinct weights
1   Initialize a forest T to be a set of one-vertex trees, one for each vertex of the graph.
2   While T has more than one component:
3     For each component C of T:
4       Begin with an empty set of edges S
5       For each vertex v in C:
6         Find the cheapest edge from v to a vertex outside of C, and add it to S
7       Add the cheapest edge in S to T
8 
    Combine trees connected by edges to form bigger components
9   Output: T is the minimum spanning tree of G.


Kruskal's algorithm: (see https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/960206.html)
    sort the edges of G in increasing order by length
    keep a subgraph S of G, initially empty
    for each edge e in sorted order
        if the endpoints of e are disconnected in S
        add e to S
    return S
