\subsection{Problem 50} \textbf{Consecutive prime sum}\newline

Python, about 35 ms.
I start with sums of primes from 2, and find the longest sequence of primes that sum to a prime, then do the same from 3, and stop once it is not possible to find a sequence longer than the longest already found, which starts from 7.

I use a 3.5x faster version of David Epstein's very nice primes generator, and a simple 6n±1 test for primality that I have used on other problems.\newline

\subsection{Problem 60} \textbf{Prime pair sets}\newline

Bah! I cannot get this to go any quicker than about 3.6 s. At least that is way faster than the 120 s+ I was getting when I first solved this.

I  first generate a dictionary of primes $p_i$ up to some limit, then to each of these I attach a set of the other primes in that dict, $p_j$, for which the concatenations $p_ip_j$ and $p_jp_i$ are prime. I then use set intersections to find the primes that connect to however many others is required. 

Creating the dictionary takes 90\% of the total time.

Creating primes is far faster than checking for primality - so if checking is what you want to do, then it can be faster to put lots of primes in a data structure with constant look-up time, such as a Python set or dictionary, then check whether your candidate prime is in that structure.

This problem is clearly amenable to graph-theoretical analysis, and what I have done resembles looking for cliques in a graph. I look forward to pursuing this more explicitly.\newline

\subsection{Problem 68: }\textbf{Magic 5-gon ring}\newline

About 3 ms in Python. Quick, but not very concise, mind. The main time saving arose from recognising that the central ring had to consist of  digits 1 to [i]n[/i] for an [i]n[/i]-gon ring (if I don't make that assumption, then my code takes 2 s)  and a common task was to cycle lists and recognise when two lists were identical within a rotation of the n-gon. 

I probably could use itertools-esque things to do some of the work in the code, and may do so when I find out how, but I did find that the lexicographic order you get from $\texttt{itertools.combinations()}$ messed up the required clockwise-ness of the ring when I tried to take all pairs within the ring that would form part of complete rows.\newline

\subsection{Problem 70: }\textbf{Totient permutation}\newline


After first posting here my original solution which took 400s, here is an update that gets the answer in 0.75 s or so. It guesses that the minimal ratio of $\frac{n}{\phi(n)}$, if $n$ cannot be prime (since then $\phi(n)$ would be $n-1$ and it would not have the same digits as $n$) occurs when $n$ has two distinct prime factors, these both being around $\sqrt{n}$. I search for factors within a factor 3 of $\sqrt{n}$ and use the fact that, where a number $n$ has two distinct prime factors, $p_1$ and $p_2$, then $\phi(n)=(p_1-1)(p_2-1)$.\newline

\subsection{Problem 74: } \textbf{Digit factorial chains}\newline

About 50 ms*, in Python.

I only check for numbers with integers that increase in order, then find the number of valid permutations of those digits - all permutations must have the same chain length. To speed things up when working through chains, I develop a dictionary of the chain lengths found for all numbers that have appeared in chains before, and stop when I get to one of these numbers, because the chain length of the present number can now be calculated directly. This saves a lot of time.

When I first solved the problem using brute force, my code required 70 s. Getting the dictionary/cache method to work correctly (which took me ages!) brought that down by a factor of 20 to 3.5 s, then the realisation that digit order did not matter brought the time down by a further factor of 70, to 50 ms.\newline

\subsection{Problem 78} \textbf{Coin partitions}

In Python, with much the same recursive code that I used for Problem 76, based on generalised pentagonal numbers and using memoization. To speed things up I take the observation of Ramanujan that if $n$ ends in 4 or 9, then $p(n)$ is divisible by 5, and hence this will capture all the $p(n)$ that are divisible by powers of 10.

\begin{verbatim}
def p2(n,memo={}):
    if n<0:
        return 0
    if n==0:
        return 1
    try:
        return memo[n]
    except:       
        result=sum([(-1)**(k-1)*(p2(n-k*(3*k-1)//2,memo)+p2(n-k*(3*k+1)//2,memo)) for k in range(1,int(sqrt(n)+1))])
        memo[n]=result
        return result
            
def PE_0078(ll,ul,divisor):
    for n in range(ll+4,ul+4,5):
        a=p2(n)
        if a%divisor==0:
            print (n,a)
            break
\end{verbatim}

Most of my problems here were not with this code, but with the Python, or maybe Spyder environment. The first time I run this it takes about 15s, but the next time it only needs a few ms. I don't know why. For a lot of today, the kernel kept dying while I attempted less than  I have posted here, for example in computing $p(10000)$, while earlier it had managed much more, which is why I know that $p(846699)$ and $p(488324)$ are also divisible by 1 million. Finally, I found that if I crept slowly upwards in the value of $n$ before I run the code, all was fine. Why is that? Anyway, very interesting problem.

\subsection{Problem 114}

$50-100 \mu\text{s}$ in Python, using recursion and a memo. For block lengths up to 3 units I worked out the number of solutions that had a red left-most block, or a black left-most block, and put these pairs of values in a dictionary with the block length as key. Then, working upwards in block lengths one unit at a time, I imagined placing $k=1$ to $n$ black blocks at  the left-most end. For each value $k$, this  gave a rightward space of $n-k$ blocks in length that had to be filled with  any allowed combination of sub-blocks that had a red left-most edge. I could look this value up in the dictionary. The sum of these values for each $k$ then gave the number of solutions for blocks of length $n$ with a black left edge. To find the solutions for $n$ units that have a red edge, I do the same, starting this time with a red block of 3 units at the left edge.

In fact, on inspecting the numbers for the first few block lengths, one sees that the recursion relation is:

\begin{align*}
n_{\text{black left edge}}(L)&=n_{\text{black left edge}}(L-1)+n_{\text{red left edge}}(L-1)\\
n_{\text{red left edge}}(L)&=n_{\text{black left edge}}(L-3)+n_{\text{red left edge}}(L-1)
\end{align*}


Here are the values up to $L=20$:

\subsection{Problem 213: }\textbf{Flea Circus}\newline

About 550ms in Python, without taking any symmetries into account..

I use a Markov chain. First I construct the transition matrix $\mathbf{P}$, then for each flea I calculate the probability that it would not occupy each of the cells after $n$ bells. This is given by $1-\mathbf{P}^n\mathbf{t}$ where $\mathbf{t}$ is a column vector of zeros, except for $t_i=1$ when we consider the \textit{i}th flea. Starting with a value of 1 for the probability of any cell being empty, I multiply that at each stage by the probability for each flea not ending up there. After all fleas are accounted for, we have the probability that each cell is unoccupied after $n$ steps. The sum of these probabilities is the expected number of empty cells.

This was clearly solvable as an absorbing Markov chain problem, so I spent a happy day or two reading more on them. [url=https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf]Grinstead and Snell[/url] Chapter 11 was particularly useful.

First, for $2N$ players I used pen and paper to construct the $N+1$ square transition matrix $\mathbf{P}$, with the element $p_{ij}$ being the probability for transition from a state where the dice are a distance $N-i$ apart to one where they are a distance $N-j$ apart. That is, a transition between states a distant $N$ apart is in the top left and the element for the transition that begins and ends on the absorbing  state of zero distance apart is in the bottom right. The top-left $N$ by $N$ sub-matrix of this is $\mathbf{Q}$.  It's elements give the probabilities of transitions between transitory states. 

Then we construct $\mathbf{N}=(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{Q})^{-1}$. Grinstead and Snell call $\mathbf{N}$ the [i]fundamental[/i] matrix for $\mathbf{P}$. An entry $n_{ij}$ of $\mathbf{N}$ is the expected number of times that the chain will be in state $s_j$ if it starts in state $s_i$. Finally, we let $t_i$ be the expected number of steps before the chain is absorbed, given that the chain starts in state $s_i$, and let $\mathbf{t}$ be the column vector whose [i]i[/i]th entry is $t_i$. Then
$$\mathbf{t}=\mathbf{N}\mathbf{c}$$
where $\mathbf{c}$ is a column vector all of whose entries are 1. The answer to our problem is given by $t_0$.

\subsection{Problem 243}

About 0.3 ms in Python. I use the same ideas as many here, noting that $R(d)=\frac{\phi(n)}{n-1}\approx \frac{\phi(n)}{n}$ for large $n$, and so is a function only of the prime factors of $n$, independent of the exponents of those factors. The denominator will be minimised if $n$ is a primorial. Thus we look for the smallest primorial number for which $\frac{\phi (n)}{n}< \frac{15499}{94744}$and then multiply that successively by 2 until $\frac{\phi(n)}{n-1}< \frac{15499}{94744}$, knowing that by doing so we will not change the value of $\frac{\phi(n)}{n}$.

\subsection{Problem 285}

I took an unreasonably long time to solve this, and the code takes about 15s, but I have had fun times reading up on transformed distributions. Larry Wasserman's book 'All of Statistics' is great for this. I spent a long time staring at a $(1,(k+1)^2)$ square, but missed the key insight of the first post of this forum!

I tried and failed to find the cdf  for the transformed distribution $Y=(kx_1+1)^2+(kx_2+1)^2$ where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$. Eventually, I asked Mathematica to do the job for me for $k=1,2,3,4...$, and pieced together the general expression for the cdf $F$ from them. The expected score then followed easily as $$\sum_{k=1}^{100000}{k\cdot \left(F\left[(k+0.5)^2\right]-F\left[(k-0.5)^2\right]\right)}$$

\subsection{Problem 407}
\par
Just meeting the 1000s rule in Python. :( 

But, it is good to be here, at last :)

As of now I cannot see how to speed things up, using this method: I find the prime factors of each $n$, and then, via the Chinese Remainder Theorem, I find one idempotent per prime factor, and then all others as a power set of combinations of these. I couldn't work out how to avoid calculating all $a$ for each $n$.

\subsection{Problem 512}
 I managed to work out that $\displaystyle g(n) = \sum_{i=1,i \nmid 2}^n \varphi(i)$ and then did the sum by brute-force sieving in 6 minutes.
 
 $$\sum _{i=1}^n \phi \left(n^i\right)=\frac{\left(n^n-1\right) \phi (n)}{n-1}$$
 
 $$(\left(\sum _{i=1}^n \phi \left(n^i\right)\right) \bmod (n+1))=(\left((\frac{n^n-1}{n-1} \bmod (n+1)) (\phi (n) \bmod (n+1))\right) \bmod (n+1))$$
 
 $$(\frac{n^n-1}{n-1} \bmod (n+1))=1$$
 
 Hence
 
 $$\displaystyle g(n) = \sum_{i=1,i \nmid 2}^n \varphi(i)$$

\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np
import time

def p512(n):
    t=time.clock()
    primes=primesieve(n)
    g=sum(etsieve(n,primes)[1::2])
    print(g,time.clock()-t)

def etsieve(n,primes):
    """return array of euler totient(x) for x from 2 to n"""
    sieve=np.array(range(n+1),dtype=float)
    for i in primes:  
        if sieve[i]==i:
            sieve[i::i]*=(1-1/i)
    return sieve.astype(int)
    
def primesieve(n):
    """return array of primes 2<=p<=n"""
    sieve=np.ones(n+1,dtype=bool)
    for i in range(2, int((n+1)**0.5+1)):
        if sieve[i]:
            sieve[2*i::i]=False
    return np.nonzero(sieve)[0][2:]
\end{verbatim}

To get it within one minute, I had to understand how to sum totients without actually calculating them. This is covered in daniel fischer's excellent overview to problem 73 and in [url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/316376/how-to-calculate-these-totient-summation-sums-efficiently.]this stack exchange page[/url] (see the post by 'Andy'), which is also used by the very helpful post earlier in this forum from  chsl95. This code (which is essentially the same as that of chsl95) goes in about 10s.

\begin {verbatim}
def p512v2(n):
    t=time.clock()
    print(oddTotientSum(n))
    print(time.clock()-t)

def R2(N,X2={}):
    if N==1:
        return 0
    try:
        return X2[N]
    except KeyError:
        fsum = F2(N)
        m=2
        while 1:
            x = N//m
            nxt = N//x
            if(nxt >= N):
                result=fsum - (N-m+1)*R2(N//m,X2)
                X2[N]=result
                return result
            fsum -= (nxt-m+1) * R2(N//m,X2)
            m = nxt+1

#returns sum of totients of x<=n
#wrapper for R2
#sum of totient(x) for x<=n
def totientSum(n):
    return R2(n)+1
    
#sum of totient(x) for x<=n and x is even
def evenTotientSum(N):
    if N < 2:
        return 0
    return totientSum(N//2)+evenTotientSum(N//2)

#sum of totient(x) for x<=n and x is odd (answer to PE p512)    
def oddTotientSum(N):
    return totientSum(N)-evenTotientSum(N)
\end{verbatim}
The key insight I got from chsl95 is how to calculate the sum of totients of even numbers.

\subsection{Problem 540: }\textbf{Counting primitive Pythagorean triples}\newline

We use parametrization of Pythagorean triples: $a=p^2-q^2, b=2pq, c=p^2+q^2$, where $q<p$, $p$ and $q$ have different parity and are relatively prime. If we require that $c\leq n$ then the number of valid $p,q$ pairs, without restriction except that $p,q>0, q<p$, is:

\begin{align*}
C(n) &=\sum_{\mathclap{q<p, p^2+q^2\leq n} }1 \\
&=  \sum_{\mathclap{2q^2<n}}{\left(\left\lfloor\sqrt{n-q^2}\right\rfloor-q\right)}
\end{align*}

We need to subtract from this the number of $p,q$ pairs that are either not  co-prime or have the same parity.


\subsection{Problem 613: }\textbf{Pythagorean Ant}

I imagined four quadrants, with axes parallel to the triangle sides of length 3 and 4. If the ant walked off in the quadrant facing the hypotenuse it was certain to exit the triangle on that side, and if it walked off towards the right angle, it was certain not to. That left the other two quadrants. For each of these I derived an expression for the probability of exit across the hypotenuse,  to find:


$$P(\text{exit})=\frac{1}{4}\left(1+\frac{2}{\pi}\left(\frac{1}{4} \int^4_0\tan^{-1}\frac{x}{3} dx + \frac{1}{3} \int^3_0\tan^{-1}\frac{x}{4} dx\right)\right)$$

which, with Mathematica's help, I find integrates to:

$$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{-25\log{5}+9\log{3}+32\log{2}}{24\pi}$$

where we use the fact that the two smaller angles of the triangle sum to $\pi/2$.
