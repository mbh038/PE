Description: This module was created to supplement Python's itertools module, filling in gaps in the following areas of basic combinatorics: (A) ordered and unordered m-way combinations, (B) generalizations of the four basic occupancy problems ('balls in boxes'), and (C) constrained permutations, otherwise known as the 'off-by-m' problem.
